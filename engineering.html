        <p class="chalk-body mt-1">
Engineering is more than just writing code; it is the art of solving problems. 
Think of it like building with digital blocks. We show you how to take a big, 
confusing idea and break it down into small, simple steps that actually work. 
Whether you are building your first website or a complex app, we help you 
understand the "why" behind the "how" so you can build with confidence.

<h2>Audience</h2>

<p>This research is for everyone who wish to learn about computer science and programming methods. You may be a student, engineer, or scientist from another domain who wishes to transition into tech. You can follow this research even if you don't know any programming language, actually you will learn several interesting programming languages during this research.</p>

<h2>Curriculum</h2>

<p>CSP include most essential topics in computer science and programming. You will learn: the fundamental concepts of programming, web design, databases and operating systems. We also have an optional short course for hardware enthusiasts that will provide you with the knowledge and skills you need to build your own computer.</p>

<h2>Benefits</h2>

<p>Software engineering is a rapidly growing field, and there is a high demand for qualified software engineers. If you are interested in a career in software engineering, now is the time to start learning the skills you need to succeed. At start you will feel like an impostor. Don't warry, at the end of this lap you will feel more confident. Here are your most important benefits following this roadmap:</p>

<ul>
<li>Increased job opportunities. Certification can help you stand out from the competition and increase your chances of getting hired. Many employers are looking for certified software engineers, as it shows that you have the skills and knowledge necessary to do the job.</li>
<li>Higher salaries. Certified software engineers typically earn higher salaries than those who are not certified. This is because employers are willing to pay more for employees who have the skills and knowledge that they need.</li>
<li>Professional development. Certification can help you stay up-to-date on the latest trends and technologies in the software engineering field. This can help you improve your skills and knowledge, which can lead to career advancement.</li>
<li>Personal satisfaction. Certification can give you a sense of accomplishment and boost your confidence. It can also help you feel more satisfied with your career, as you know that you have the skills and knowledge necessary to be successful.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="rm">Roadmap</h2>

<p>Not all Engineers are the same. You can follow topics in random order, that covers most interesting skills for your personal customized path. You can study: web-design, software architecture, databases design or operating systems depending on your goals. However, remember: fundamentals never change. Learn the fundamentals first, before diving into advanced topics.</p>

<h2 id="hw">Hardware fundamentals</h2>

<p>Understanding hardware fundamentals is essential for anyone interested in engineering and technology. This includes knowledge of electricity, electronics, devices, cables, connectors, and industry standards. In next section, we've compiled articles to help you learn the basics of computer hardware. You'll gain the skills needed to set up your own home network and prepare for a career as an independent tech professional.</p>

We do not collect e-mail addresses and do not send you unsolicited messages. Your results are stored for 30 days securely on Google drive for review and support.</div>

<hr>

<h3>Second Chance</h3>

<p>You can take this quiz only once. After first try, you can request support on Discord. An instructor can review your answers and reset your score so you can try this exam a second time. If you fail a second time we assume you have not follow the class properly so you should repeat the class. You can take the quiz after 30 days anyhow because we prune old results.
</p>

<h3>Next Step</h3>

<p>Have you follow this roadmap? Good. Now is time to decide what to do next. You can continue to study on Sage-Code Laboratory with programming roadmap. <b>CSP</b> "Computer Programming", and learn more programming languages. You can  get a cerification of completion and then start your own project. Programmer life is competitive and challanging but rewarding. Learn and prosper!</p>

<h2>Engineering Books</h2>
<p>
In case you want to study more offline, download some PDF books. We have created a selection of englinneering books, available on Ko-Fi shop, that have been specially created for Sage-Code community. These books were developed with the assistance of AI to provide valuable learning resources. You can read these books on any device that can display PDF. The books are free or pay what you want, but you need to be a subscriber to our shop to dowload these books. Our books are updated from time to time, so you can download latest version if you are a subscriber.
