<h1>Software Engineering</h1>

<div class="alert alert-secondary shadow-sm">Welcome to Software Engineering introductory course (CSE). What is Software Engineering? It's a branch of computer science that deals with the design, implementation, and maintenance of complex computer programs. It consists of systematic application of engineering methods to software production. The term <em>"software engineering"</em> emerged in 1960s as a response to the software crisis, where software development struggled to keep up with hardware advancements.
</div>

<h2>Audience</h2>

<p>This course is for everyone who wish to learn about computer science and programming methods. You may be a student, engineer, or scientist from another domain who wishes to transition into tech. Regardless of your age, background, or experience, we encourage you to follow this course. You can take this course even if you don't know any programming language!</p>
