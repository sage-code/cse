<h2>CSS Animation</h2>

<div class="alert alert-secondary shadow-sm">
  CSS animations and transitions are two powerful tools that can be used to add visual interest and interactivity to web pages. Both CSS animations and transitions can be used to create a variety of visual effects. However, there are some key differences between the two.
</div>

<p>CSS animations allow you to create smooth, gradual changes to the appearance of an element over time. For example, you could use CSS animations to make a button fade in or out, or to change the color of an element from one color to another.</p>

<p>CSS animations are more complex than transitions. They require you to specify the start and end states of the animation, as well as the timing and easing of the animation.</p>

<h3>Animation Example</h3>

<p>Here is an example of a CSS animation that fades in a button over a period of 2 seconds:</p>

<pre><code class="language-css">
#animated_button {
  background-color: green;
  color: white;
  transition: opacity 2s;
}

#animated_button:hover {
  animation: fade-in 2s linear;
  background-color: purple;
}
</code></pre>

<!-- live examle -->
<style>
@keyframes fade-in {
  0% {
    opacity: 0;
  }

  100% {
    opacity: 1;
  }
}

#animated_button {
  height:50px;
  width: 150px;
  border-radius: 5px;
  background-color: green;
  color: white;
  border: none;
  transition: opacity 2s;
}

#animated_button:hover {
  animation: fade-in 2s linear;
  background-color: purple;
}
</style>

<!-- animated button -->
<hr>
<div class="text-center">
  <button id="animated_button">Animated Button</button>
</div>
<hr>

<h3>Animation Rules</h3>

<p>CSS animations allow you to create dynamic and interactive web pages. They can be used to animate the properties of any element, including the position, size, color, and opacity of an element.
</p>
<p>The "@keyframes" rule is used to define animation sequences in CSS. It is a semantic rule, which means that it has a specific meaning and purpose. The syntax for the "@keyframes" rule is as follows:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">
@keyframes animation-name {
  from {
    ...
  }
  to {
    ...
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The "animation-name" property is the name of the animation sequence. The "from" and "to" keywords define the start and end states of the animation. The "..." in the code snippets above represents the CSS properties that will be animated.
</p>
<p>Here is an example of a "@keyframes" rule that animates the width of an element from 0 to 100px over a period of 1 second:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">
@keyframes width-animation {
  from {
    width: 0px;
  }
  to {
    width: 100px;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>
To use this animation, you would add the following code to your CSS:
</p>

<pre><code class="language-css">
.element {
  animation: width-animation 1s linear;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The "animation" property specifies the name of the animation sequence to use. The "1s" property specifies the duration of the animation in seconds. The "linear" property specifies the timing function for the animation.
</p>

<h3>Animation Properties</h3>

<p>In next table we list all animation properties with description. Use these properties in CSS to create the animation rules.</p>

<table class="table table-bordered table-dark table-striped">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Property</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Values</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>animation-name</td>
      <td>The name of the animation.</td>
      <td>A string, or a comma-separated list of strings.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>animation-duration</td>
      <td>The duration of the animation, in seconds.</td>
      <td>A number, or a string with a unit of time, such as "2s" or "100ms".</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>animation-timing-function</td>
      <td>The timing function of the animation.</td>
      <td>One of the following values: linear, ease, ease-in, ease-out, ease-in-out, cubic-bezier(x1, y1, x2, y2), or steps(n, step-start, step-end).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>animation-delay</td>
      <td>The delay before the animation starts, in seconds.</td>
      <td>A number, or a string with a unit of time, such as "2s" or "100ms".</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>animation-iteration-count</td>
      <td>The number of times the animation should be played.</td>
      <td>A number, or the keyword infinite.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>animation-direction</td>
      <td>The direction in which the animation should play.</td>
      <td>One of the following values: normal, reverse, or alternate.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>animation-fill-mode</td>
      <td>How the animation should be applied before and after it plays.</td>
      <td>One of the following values: none, forwards, backwards, or both.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2>CSS Transitions</h2>
<p>CSS transitions allow you to create smooth, gradual changes to the appearance of an element when its properties are changed. For example, you could use CSS transitions to make an element grow or shrink when its width or height is changed.</p>

<p>CSS transitions are simpler than animations. They only require you to specify the start and end states of the transition. The timing and easing of the transition are handled automatically by the browser.</p>

<h3>Transition Example</h3>

<p>Here is an example of a CSS transition that changes the color of an element from red to blue over a period of 1 second:</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">
  #transition_button {
    height:50px;
    width: 150px;
    background-color: green;
    color: white;
    border: none;
    cursor: pointer;
    transition: background-color 0.8s ease-in-out;
    border-radius: 5px;
  }
  
  #transition_button:hover {
    background-color: purple;
  }
</code></pre>

<!-- live examle -->
<style>
  #transition_button {
    height:50px;
    width: 150px;
    background-color: green;
    color: white;
    border: none;
    cursor: pointer;
    transition: background-color 0.8s ease-in-out;
    border-radius: 5px;
  }
  
  #transition_button:hover {
    background-color: purple;
  }
</style>

<!-- transition button -->
<hr>
<div class="text-center">
  <button id="transition_button">Transition Button</button>
</div>
<hr>

<h3>Transition Rules</h3>

<p>
CSS transitions allow you to create smooth animations between the states of an element. They are a more lightweight way to create animations than CSS animations, and they are also more efficient.
</p>
<p>The syntax for CSS transition rules is as follows:
</p>
<pre>
transition: property duration timing-function delay;
</pre>
<p>The "property" property specifies the property that will be animated. The "duration" property specifies the duration of the animation in seconds. The "timing-function" property specifies the timing function for the animation. The "delay" property specifies the delay before the animation starts.
</p>

<p>The "width" property specifies the property that will be animated. The "1s" property specifies the duration of the animation in seconds. The "linear" property specifies the timing function for the animation. The "0s" property specifies the delay before the animation starts.
</p>

<p>Here is a table that summarizes the syntax and semantic of CSS transition rules:

        <td>One or more comma-separated property names, followed by a space and a timing function.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>transition-property</td>
        <td>Defines the properties that will be transitioned.</td>
        <td>One or more CSS properties.</td>

      </tr>
      <tr>

        <td>Defines the timing function of the transition.</td>

        <td>transition-delay</td>

        <td>A number, or a string with a unit of time, such as "2s" or "100ms".</td>
      </tr>

   Good job. You have made it here. Now, right click on page to open context menu.
   Now search for menu option "View page source"  (Ctrl+U) and press it.
   Or you can inspect a particular element by pressing "Inspect Element" (Ctrl+Shift+I).
