<h1>Computer Infrastructure</h1>

<div class="alert alert-secondary shadow-sm">Computer infrastructure for home or office is the underlying system of hardware, software, and networking that allows computers to communicate and function together. It includes the following three main components: hardware devices, software platforms and networking components.</div>

<ul>
  <li><b>Hardware</b>: This includes the physical devices that make up a computer system, such as the computer case, motherboard, processor, memory, storage devices, and input/output devices.</li>
  <li><b>Software</b>: This includes the programs that run on a computer system, such as the operating system, applications, and utilities.</li>
  <li><b>Networking</b>: This includes the hardware and software that allows computers to communicate with each other and with the internet.</li>
  </ul>

<h2 id="general">General Considerations</h2>

<p>Computer infrastructure is essential for any home or office that uses computers. It provides the foundation for all of the computing activities that take place, such as browsing the internet, using email, word processing, and spreadsheets.</p>

<p>The specific components of computer infrastructure will vary depending on the size and needs of the home or office. For example, a small home office may only need a few computers and a basic router, while a large enterprise may need a complex network of servers, storage devices, and networking equipment.</p>

<p>However, regardless of the size or complexity of the computer infrastructure, it is important to properly maintain it in order to ensure that it is reliable and secure. This includes regular updates of hardware and software, as well as monitoring of the network for potential security threats.</p>

<h2 id="strategy">Infrastructure Strategy</h2>

<p>Company infrastructure include servers and desktop computers connected in a network. These days, any computer enthusiasts can own several computers in a network at home. To build and maintain your own server is fun and interesting activity. Though cloud computing and data centers are replacing small servers, some companies may continue to maintain private networks for development or data management, to avoid security issues or higher cost.</p>

<p>In addition to security and cost, another reason why some companies may choose to own private networks is for compliance reasons. For example, a company that handles sensitive data, such as financial or medical information, may be required to keep that data on-premises in order to comply with regulations. An Engineer must be prepared to design and understend private and public networks.</p>

<h3 id="intranet">Intranet Infrastructure</h3>

<p>An intranet is a private network that is accessible only to authorized users, such as employees of a company. It is typically built on the same underlying technology as the internet, but it is isolated from the public internet. This makes it more secure for businesses that work with sensitive customer data.</p>

<h4>Advantages</h4>

<p>Here are some of the advantages of using an intranet infrastructure for an office:</p>

<ul>
<li>Increased security: Since intranets are isolated from the public internet, they are less vulnerable to cyberattacks.</li>
<li>Improved collaboration: Intranets can make it easier for employees to collaborate on projects and share information.</li>
<li>Reduced costs: Intranets can help businesses to reduce costs by eliminating the need for expensive software licenses and hardware.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Disadvantages</h4>

<p>Here are some of the disadvantages of using an intranet infrastructure for an office:</p>

<ul>
<li>Limited access: Since intranets are private networks, they can only be accessed by authorized users. This can make it difficult for businesses to share information with partners or customers.</li>
<li>Lack of flexibility: Intranets can be difficult to customize, which can limit their usefulness for businesses with unique needs.</li>
<li>Security risks: Even though intranets are isolated from the public internet, they are not immune to cyberattacks. Businesses need to take steps to secure their intranets, such as implementing strong passwords and firewalls.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cloud">Cloud Infrastructure</h3>

<p>An cloud based infrastructure is a network that is accessible to the public. This means that businesses that use internet based infrastructure need to take extra precautions to protect their customer data from cyberattacks.</p>

<h4>Advantages</h4>

<p>Here are some of the advantages of using an internet based infrastructure for an office:</p>

<ul>
<li>Wider access: Since internet based infrastructures are accessible to the public, they can make it easier for businesses to share information with partners and customers.</li>
<li>Greater flexibility: Internet based infrastructures are more flexible than intranets and can be customized to meet the specific needs of businesses.</li>
<li>Lower costs: Internet based infrastructures can be less expensive than intranets, especially for small businesses.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Disadvantages</h4>

<p>Here are some of the disadvantages of using an internet based infrastructure for an office:</p>

<ul>
<li>Increased security risks: Since internet based infrastructures are accessible to the public, they are more vulnerable to cyberattacks.</li>
<li>More complex to manage: Internet based infrastructures can be more complex to manage than intranets.</li>
<li>Higher bandwidth requirements: Internet based infrastructures require more bandwidth than intranets.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ultimately, the best infrastructure for an office will depend on the specific needs of the business. Businesses that work with sensitive customer data may want to consider using an intranet infrastructure, while businesses that need to share information with partners or customers may want to use an internet based infrastructure.</p>

<h2 id="features">Feature Comparison</h2>

<p>AI comparison generated table. As you can see, AI believe that cloud server has advantages over private server. I personaly desagree. Having your own server is beneficial on long term. Electricity is not so expensive and the server have become very small. In the future, people will have private servers in small offices and developers will work from home.</p>

<div class="alert alert-info"><b>Note: </b>We have decided to build our own data center and host SaaS on these servers. We will power our servers with solar power and will reduce cost of hosting to near zero. If we provide good services, our customers will pay for data bandwith not for the hardware resources.</p></div>
