<h1>Data Storage</h1>

<div class="alert alert-secondary shadow-sm">This tutorial has two parts. In first part we teach you how to build an repair a personal computer. On second part we teach you about data storage and RAID configurations. Both parts are optional for Software Engineering.</div>

<h3>What is SSD?</h3>

<p>There is now a new disruptive technology available on the market for storing data. This is called Solid State Disk (SSD) or SSD card accelerator. An SSD is a hard drive that does not have moving parts. Is like a permanent memory storage shaped as a hard drive for convenience. A good SSD is 10 times faster than a normal HDD.</p>

<div class="center"><img src="img/ssd-drive.jpg" alt="Picture" width="500" loading="lazy" ></div>

<p>SSD has a lower capacity (128 GB, 256 GB, 500 GB) and is very appreciated as laptop storage or desktop boot drive where you can install the operating system to improve PC performance.</p>
<p>The SSD read and write fast but delete operation is a little bit slower. After multiple read and writes the disk is loosing some of the performance. For this there is a optimization software that can run from time to time to keep performance up.</p>

<h3>NVMe SSD</h3>

<p>NVMe = Non Volatile Memory Extension</p>

<p>This device is 10 times faster than SSD. For making the operating system load faster, you can use an internal NVMe These are small factor SSD that do not match older laptops or desktops. So be sure your computer supports NVMe before order. For desktop is possible to install an extension card that support NVMe. </p>

<h3>What is a HDD?</h3>

<p>The most successfully storage device and the most popular is today the hard drive (HDD). This device is an internal small box that contains mechanical and electronic parts that are used for storing large amount of data. These devices are very successful due to rapid access to read or write information. These devices are designed for desktop PC, Servers or Laptops. There are 2 standard sizes:&nbsp;<code>3.5&Prime;</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>2.5&Prime;</code>. In the next picture you can study the internal components of a HDD but the real HDD is encapsulated in a case, for protection. You can not look inside the case without a screw driver.</p>

<div class="alert alert-danger">ANY HDD IS A SEALED BOX! THIS DISK IS OPEN FOR DEMO PURPOSE. NEVER USE A SCREWDRIVER TO OPEN A HDD EXCEPT IF YOU WANT TO BREAK IT. YOU CAN'T FIX A HDD.</div>

<hr>
<p><b>Technology:</b>&nbsp;these devices are using one or several disk platters that are mounted on a spindle. The patters are easy to magnetize and demagnetize using a small coil mounted on a moving head that is reading or writing data. Some HDD are using a single disk some other are using one 2 or 3 platters on the same axis but new disks can have upt to 8 platters to increase the capacity.</p>
<p><b>Performance:</b>&nbsp;Depending on the number of disks mounted on the spindle and depending on the rotation speed, the HDD can be faster or slower. The spinning is measured in RPM (rotation per minute). For example a 15000 RPM or 10.000 RPM is used for fast responsive server side HDD while 7500 RPM is used for desktop computer while 5000 RPM disks are used for laptop computers.</p>
<p><b>Capacity:</b>&nbsp;The capacity of HDD is measured in GB (GigaByte) or TB (TeraByte). 1 TB = 1000 GB. One Byte = 8 Bit.Usually a laptop is using a single HDD of small capacity (GB) while desktop or servers can use 2 or more HDD of large capacity (TB).</p>
<p>Because HDD has moving parts it generate heat, vibrations and is subject to mechanical and thermal degradation. Today you can find HDD of large capacity up to 10 TB for servers using SATA or SAS interface or for NAS storage.</p>
