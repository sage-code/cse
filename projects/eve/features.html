<h1>Eve Language</h1>

<div class="alert alert-info shadow-sm">
  Eve empowers developers with a domain-specific, modular programming language. Designed for improved productivity and ease of learning. Eve fosters a safe, versatile, and effective environment for data manipulation tasks across various domains.  This includes working with text data, binary data (like images and video streams), and database connectivity.
</div>

<section>
  <h3>Key Features</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h4>Readable Syntax</h4>
      <p>
        Eve leverages familiar keywords and syntax inspired by established languages like Java, C++, Ada, Pascal, and Ruby. It employs an explicit, consistent, and verbose style for enhanced code readability and learning by example. Additionally, Eve supports syntax highlighting and colorization for improved code comprehension.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Effective and Productive</h4>
      <p>
        Eve is tailored towards domain-specific jobs, prioritizing developer productivity. It focuses on effectiveness over extreme efficiency or high-performance computing.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Safe and Type-Safe</h4>
      <p>
        Eve utilizes a static type system to ensure type safety. It mitigates null pointer exceptions by employing boxed values and initializing basic types with zero values.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Modular Design</h4>
      <p>
        Eve encourages code reusability through scripts and modules, promoting separation of concerns in larger projects. It offers three module types:
        <ul>
          <li><b>Drivers:</b> Serve as executable entry points for your programs.</li>
          <li><b>Aspects:</b> Represent individual processes launched from drivers and unloaded from memory upon completion.</li>
          <li><b>Modules:</b> Provide reusable but non-executable components that persist until the driver finishes.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Versatile Data Handling</h4>
      <p>
        Eve will be able to connect and manipulates data from various databases. It reads and writes diverse data formats, including text, images, and video streams. We will create specific drivers for each database we interact with and optimize data access for reliability and performance.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>

<h2>Code Example</h2>


<p>This Eve program calculates the 5th number in the Fibonacci sequence. Here's a breakdown:</p>

<pre><code class="language-eve"># Fibonacci series demonstrate
driver fibonacci:

** declare Fibonacci routine
function fib(n:Integer) => (y:Integer):
  if (n == 1) or (n == 0) then
    let y := 1; -- first value
  else
    let y := fib(n-1) + fib(n-2);
  done;
return;

process
   ** local variable for result
   new r: Integer;

   ** call fib rule using argument 5
   let r := fib(5);

   ** print the result to console
   print r;
return;
</code></pre>


<h3>Explanation</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Driver and Function Definition:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>The line "driver fibonacci:" declares the main program named "fibonacci".</li>
      <li>The line "function fib(n:Integer) => (y:Integer)" defines a function named "fib" that takes an integer "n" as input and returns an integer value.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Recursive Calculation:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>The "fib" function uses recursion to calculate the nth Fibonacci number.</li>
      <li>The "if" statement checks if "n" is either 1 or 0, which are the base cases in the sequence (both 1).</li>
      <li>The "else" block calculates "fib(n)" using the values of "fib(n-1)" and "fib(n-2)", demonstrating recursion.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Main Program Execution:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>The "process" block defines the main execution flow.</li>
      <li>A variable "r" is declared to store the result.</li>
      <li>The line "let r := fib(5);" calls the "fib" function with "5" and assigns the result (5th Fibonacci number) to "r".</li>
      <li>The "print r;" statement displays the calculated value to the console.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
