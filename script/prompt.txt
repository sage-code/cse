Help me improve my JavaScript prep quiz. Is a quiz designed for beginners to learn about JavaScript not an exam. Please create questions, each with 4 possible answers. There is only one correct obvious answer that is the first all the time. The other 3 must be incorrect. Do not use a), b), c) d) or 1. 2. 3. 4. in front of the answers use a dash (-) instead for a bule list. Start with 10 questions about variable declarations, constants, naming conventions and data literals and variable scope.
