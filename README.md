## Sage-Code Root

This is our official home website. Notice this website is open source. We use HTML+CSS and Bootstrap to create a simple static website. It is content based. We believe in collaboration rather than competition. Therefore we invite you to learn and work with us to improve this website.

Please do not push changes before testing. We validate our pages using W3 validator from time to time and we fix syntax errors. We strive to improve the quality of content by using artificial intelligence (AI).

Validate pages using: [W3 Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

Any abuse, spam, hidden ads, or self-promotion is not tolerated on our website. If we find such a contribution you will be reported. We are professionals and we do not accept PR without review. Do not break our trust!

**note**  (for contributors)

This website is self-contained. Once you have made a clone on your computer you should be able to browse on a local machine without internet connection. There is no need to install anything. So you can test the website by opening the pages locally. 

The project pages do not work locally. For every project, we use a different repository. You can clone other individual projects in different folders (sibling) to www, in the same working folder. We use a trick to make projects testable. The trick is to run the export.sh to create a link to the www/images folder. Then, the projects can use the images and the style of the main website.
