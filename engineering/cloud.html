<h2>Cloud Computing</h2>

<div class="alert alert-secondary shadow-sm">
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet. 
The term "cloud" for the internet was first used in the 1960s, when network diagrams represented the servers and networking infrastructure that make up the internet as a cloud.</div>

<div class="center">
    <img src="/images/cloud.jpg" width="500"
    class="rounded mx-auto img-fluid protect shadow"
    alt="Cloud"><p>Cloud Services</p>
</div>

<h2 id="services">Services</h2>

<p>There are three main cloud computing service models: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).</p>

<h3 id="iaas">Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</h3>

<p>IaaS provides businesses with access to the basic building blocks of cloud computing, such as virtual machines, storage, and networking. Businesses can use IaaS to build and run their own applications and services.</p>

<p>For example, a business might use IaaS to create a virtual machine to run a web server. The business would then be responsible for installing and configuring the web server software.</p>

<h3 id="paas">Platform as a Service (PaaS)</h3>

<p>PaaS provides businesses with a platform to develop, deploy, and manage applications. PaaS providers typically provide a set of pre-configured tools and services that businesses can use to build their applications.</p>

<p>For example, a business might use PaaS to create a web application. The business would not need to worry about the underlying infrastructure, such as virtual machines and storage. The PaaS provider would handle all of that.</p>

<h3 id="saas">Software as a Service (SaaS)</h3>

<p>SaaS provides businesses with access to ready-made applications that are hosted in the cloud. SaaS providers typically charge businesses a monthly subscription fee to use their applications.</p>

<p>For example, a business might use SaaS to use an email application. The business would not need to install and maintain the email application on its own servers. The SaaS provider would handle all of that.</p>

<h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2>

<ul>
<li>Scalability: Cloud computing services can be easily scaled up or down to meet the needs of businesses. This means that businesses can avoid over-provisioning or under-provisioning their resources.</li>
<li>Reliability: Cloud computing services are typically highly reliable. This is because cloud service providers have multiple data centers located in different regions.</li>
<li>Security: Cloud computing services are typically secure. Cloud service providers use a variety of security measures to protect their data centers and the data that they store.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>

<ul>
<li>Security: Despite the security measures that cloud service providers use, there is always a risk of data breaches.</li>
<li>Compliance: Businesses that use cloud computing services need to ensure that they are compliant with all applicable regulations.</li>
<li>Vendor lock-in: Businesses that rely on cloud computing services may become locked in to a particular vendor. This can make it difficult to switch to a different vendor if the need arises.</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, cloud computing service models offer a number of benefits for businesses. However, there are also some challenges that businesses need to be aware of.</p>

<h2 id="use-cases">Use Cases</h2>

<p>If you are a software engineer, it is important to learn about cloud computing. Cloud computing can help you to improve the scalability, reliability, security, and cost-effectiveness of your applications.</p>

<p>Here are some specific ways that cloud computing can be useful for software engineers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Testing and staging</li>
<li>Deployment</li>

</ul>

<p>Overall, cloud computing is a powerful tool that can be used to improve the development, deployment, and management of software applications. If you are a software engineer, it is important to learn about cloud computing and to consider how it can be used to improve your work.</p>


<h2 id="docker">Docker</h2>

<p>Docker is a containerization platform. It allows developers to package applications into containers that include all dependencies.</p>

<h4>Docker helps in:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Isolation: Containers isolate applications from each other and the underlying infrastructure.</li> 
<li>Resource efficiency: Containers share the OS kernel and use system resources efficiently.</li>
<li> Speed: Containers start up very quickly since they reuse the OS.</li> 
<li>Portability: Containers can run on any environment that supports Docker.</li>
</ul>  

<p>Docker is widely used in cloud environments to package and deploy applications. Docker containers can be deployed to VMs, servers or cloud providers.</p>

<h2 id="kubernetes">Kubernetes</h2> 

<p>Kubernetes is an open-source platform for automating the management of containerized applications.</p>

<h4>Kubernetes helps in:</h4>
<ul>
 <li>Orchestration: It can schedule and run containers across a cluster of nodes.   </li>
<li>Self-healing: It can restart and reschedule failed containers.</li> 
<li>Scaling: It can automatically scale the number of containers based on resource usage and demand.</li>
<li>Load balancing: It can distribute load between containers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Kubernetes is mainly used to orchestrate Docker containers in production at scale. It is designed to run in various environments including VMs and public clouds.</p>

<h4>So in summary:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Docker helps in packaging and deploying applications into containers.</li> 
<li>Kubernetes helps in orchestrating and managing multiple Docker containers.</li>
</ul>

<div class="alert alert-info">This combination of Docker and Kubernetes is widely used in cloud native applications to achieve scalability, availability and easy deployment. A patform engineer must understand how to configure software on these platforms to design and deplou cloud sollutions.</div>


<h2 id="cloud-providers">Cloud Providers</h2>
