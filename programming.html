<h1>Computer Programming</h1>

<div class="alert alert-secondary shadow-sm">
This course is a comprehensive and well-organized introduction to programming. It covers a wide range of topics, from basic syntax to advanced concepts. We have created these tutorials by hand before AI was invented. It may contain small spealing errors, and grammar may not be perfect but we have used our heart to provide content for learning the fundamental sytnax and semantic for multiple programming languages.</div>

<h2>Audience</h2>

<p>Anyone who wish to learn how to code is welcome to read and follow this course. We accept students, freelancers, mentors, engineers and professors who wish to learn how to code. This course is beginner friendly but you will have an advantage if you follow Software Engineering course first. Whatch the video below to check on Top Languages.</p>

<h2>Benefits</h2>

<p>This programming courses can help you learn the skills you need to become a peofessional coder. The course covers the essential syntax for various programming languages. Professional coders usually master 3 up to 5 programming languages but they are also familiar with main features of top tranding la guages. There are many benefits to learning several programming languages:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Increased problem-solving skills:</strong> Learning multiple programming languages can help you develop your problem-solving skills. This is because each language has its own strengths and weaknesses, and by learning multiple languages, you can learn how to use the right tool for the job.</li>
    <li><strong>Improved versatility:</strong> Learning multiple programming languages can make you a more versatile developer. This means that you will be able to work on a wider range of projects and be more adaptable to change.</li>
    <li><strong>Enhanced career prospects:</strong> Learning multiple programming languages can make you more marketable to employers. This is because employers are always looking for developers who are proficient in multiple languages.</li>
</ul>

<p>As ChatGPT and AI continues to develop, it will become increasingly capable of performing tasks that are currently done by human programmers. Learning multiple programming languages will help you avoid becoming obsolete. Elite programmers will still be needed to design and implement new software applications, and to solve complex problems that AI cannot.</p>

<h2>Curriculum</h2>

<p>Our course contain tutorials for 21 popular programming languages. We advice for beginners to start with one of the simplest languages: Go, Julia, Dart or Python. More advanced developers, of course can chose whatever language they prefer. Selecting your first programming language is a difficult task. Read and watch the content below, to help you decide better.</p>

<h2>Certification</h2>

<p>For every programming language we have a different quiz. Not all quizzes are ready, we work hard to make 100 questions for every quiz. In addtition we have a general quiz below that is independent of any programming language and you can take this quiz as a supliment just in case we do not have a specific other quiz you can take.</p>

<h3>Prep Quiz</h3>

<div class="alert alert-secondary shadow-sm">Next you can take a general prep quiz. If you score more than 80% at this quiz we recognize your qualification, and you can claim the Sage-Code Developer role in our organization without taking any other quiz. Use your Google account to login before you start.</div>
