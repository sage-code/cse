<h1>Computer Programming</h1>

<div class="alert alert-secondary shadow-sm">
Welcome to computer programming course (CSP). This is a comprehensive introduction to computer programming. It covers a wide range of topics, from basic syntax to advanced concepts. To complete this course you need to learn at least one programming language and pass the final quiz.</div>

<h2>Audience</h2>

<p>Anyone who wish to learn how to code, is welcome to read and follow this course.You may be student, freelancer, mentor, engineer, professor, or teacher. If you wish to learn how to code this course is for you. CSP course is beginner friendly. There is no age limit.</p>

<h2>Benefits</h2>

<p>This courses can help you learn the skills you need to become a peofessional coder fast. The course covers the essential syntax and semantic for various programming languages. Professional coders usually master 3 up to 5 programming languages. There are many benefits for learning several programming languages:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Increased problem-solving skills:</strong> Learning multiple programming languages can help you develop your problem-solving skills. This is because each language has its own strengths and weaknesses, and by learning multiple languages, you can learn how to use the right tool for the job.</li>
    <li><strong>Improved versatility:</strong> Learning multiple programming languages can make you a more versatile developer. This means that you will be able to work on a wider range of projects and be more adaptable to change.</li>
    <li><strong>Enhanced career prospects:</strong> Learning multiple programming languages can make you more marketable to employers. This is because employers are always looking for developers who are proficient in multiple languages.</li>
</ul>

<p>As ChatGPT and AI continues to develop, it will become increasingly capable of performing tasks that are currently done by human programmers. Learning multiple programming languages will help you avoid becoming obsolete. Elite programmers will still be needed to design and implement new software applications, and to solve complex problems that AI cannot.</p>

<h2>Curriculum</h2>

<p>Our course contains tutorials for 22 popular programming languages. We advice for beginners to start with one of these languages: Go, Julia, Dart or Python. More advanced developers: Rust, TypeScript or whatever other language they prefer. Selecting your first programming language is a difficult and important task. Read my external blog articles from below, to help you decide.</p>
