<h1>Maj Description</h1>

<div class="alert alert-info shadow-sm mt-4">
The most valuable resource of humanity is its capacity for communication and reasoning. But what if the languages we use today are a bottleneck? Maj is a new language designed from the ground up to be more efficient, logical, and expressive, acting as a direct upgrade to our thought processes.
</div>

<p>Maj language is logical, engineered language, designed to be simple and regular. It has about 5200 words. This is not a programming language, is a communication solution designed for, reasoning, chat and games. Because is simple anyone can learn it faster than normal human spoken languages that are much more difficult.</p>

<p>I am a polymath who has taught himself eight languages and fixed millions of lines of code. I have a deep understanding of what makes a language easy or hard to learn. I've taken all of that knowledge and built a perfect language from the ground up, designed to be an ideal tool for human communication and learning. This isn't just another conlang, this is a solution to a problem, humans do not even acknowledge that exists. And this problem is a big! Otherwise all humans would be able to learn a second language.</p>

<h2>Polyglot Resource</h2>

<p>We have created: "Discover Maj" book. This book is free to download for anyone who visit our Ko-Fi shop. You can set price 0 or pay what you want. For this book you do not need a subscription and you can download the book many times to get a fresh copy. This book explain Latin Alphabet, IPA pronunciation and writing for Maj. Is a Polyglot resource to learn words in 4 other languages: Romanian, Italian, French and Portuguese. It contains minimalist visual vocabulary and Maj grammar.</p>

<h4>GitHub Repository</h4>

<p>Maj is open source. You can check MAJ repositories on the project page. As a Sage-Code developer you can contribute to our project directly without forking. All details are available on read.me files for contributors. Check our projects page and make a clone for further research. This is a great opportunity to keep track of changes and use our content offline:</p>

<h2>Maj Reasons</h2>

<p>There are some good reasons to make a new language:</p>

<ul>
<li>Erosion of linguistic diversity has reduced the number of languages to around 6,500;</li>
<li>Languages become more complex as time pass and therefore difficult to learn;</li>
<li>Languages are difficult to optimize due to government intervention and static culture;</li>
<li>Languages have errors that nobody care to fix that makes some of them ambiguous;</li>
<li>Languages progress is real slow, lagging behind scientific and technologic descoveries.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Maj Purpose:</h2>

<p>Maj language has several potential use-cases:</p>

<ol>
<li>playground for creative software in language processing and games;</li>
<li>learning how to use tools to organize a large and challenging project;</li>
<li>study grammar and vocabulary of other languages like Romanian, French, Spanish, Portugese and Italian;</li>
<li>experiment with different words and sounds comming from other languages;</li>
</ol>

<h2>Maj Attributes:</h2>

<p>Maj language, will have the following attributes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Regular      - with deterministic reading rules;</li>
<li>Efficient    - short words and simple grammar;</li>
<li>Innovative   - logic and comprehensive;</li>
</ul>


<h3>Maj is Regular</h3>

<p>Maj have shorter words to reduce cost of typing; so Maj can be faster and more efficient than other languages; after initial calculation we estimate Maj is on average 20% more efficient than other languages. Also we try to make Maj more efficient by reducing number of words required in sentences; therefore Maj has an unusually large number of verbs.</p>

<p><strong>Rules:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Maj frequent words are shorter while less frequent words are longer;</li>
<li>Maj can use prefixes and suffixes to make a new word from a root;</li>
<li>Maj letters are pronounced the same in all words regardless of word origin;</li>
</ul>

<h3>Maj is Efficient</h3>

<p>We strive to make Maj efficient. Our main method is to make short words. We aim for Maj to be crisp and elegant easy to pronounce. We avoid long clasters of consonants (3 or more consonants) but we use sometimes two consonants side by side, and make words shorter.</p>

<p>Many words are related in Maj by using a common root with different ending vowel: {"a", "e", "o", "u", "h", "i"} to create groups of related words. In the next example you can see a regular noun and a regular verb.</p>

<p><strong>Regular Noun:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>poma = fruit </li>
<li>pome = fruits</li>
<li>pomo = fruitful</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Verb example:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>doza = dizziness</li>
<li>dozo = dizzy</li>
<li>dozu = getting dizzy</li>
</ul>

<p>This verb can change the status of something or somebody. The new status becomes an adjective. Also this verb ce infer a new abstract thing called "doza". And this can be used as a noun. Maj is rigid, do not use other forms. If we need another form for a root we may add more letters</p>

<h3>Maj is Experimental:</h3>

<p>Maj is experimental and not perfect. In our defense it was created simple on purpose to be logic and easy to learn. One major issue of Maj is the high similarity between two short words. Sometimes words that have nothing in common may look alike, having just a vowel difference. We try to identify these situations by creating longer words.</p>

<h4>Examples:</h4>
<ul>
<li>rota = wheel</li>
<li>ruta = route</li>
</ul>

<p>One single letter can be read wrong and this can change the meaning of the sentence. Maj is not error tolerant and this is bad because we can not use error correction algorithms. There will be no spell check for Maj. You must be careful to type it correctly.</p>


<p class="text-center">This project is a massive undertaking, but its potential is limitless. We are actively seeking brilliant minds to help us develop Maj. If you are a linguist, a programmer, a philosopher, or simply someone who believes in the power of a new idea, we need you. Your expertise can help us shape a language that will empower generations to come.
</p>

<p>Your passion for communication can help us build the future of language. To join our core team, your first step is to dive deep into the Maj language itself. We have already built the foundational elements, and by studying our existing work, you will gain a new perspective on communication and understand the disruptive vision behind Maj. Ready to begin your journey? Letâ€™s start with the Maj Alphabet and writing symbols.</p>
