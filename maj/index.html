<h1>About Maj School</h1>

<div class="alert alert-secondary shadow-sm">Welcome to Maj School! This is a virtual school dedicated to teaching you a secondary language. We believe that Language learning skills are essential for personal and professional grouth. Our school is open for everyone who wants to develop his personal skills and learn a new language. Maj School goes beyound learning a new language, we also create our own language.</div>


<h2>Our Learning Method</h2>

<p>Maj school offer digital books (PDF) and printed books, on Amazon. These books contain QR code that link to videos and quizzes. You can watch the videos on YouTube for free, but the videos are not self sufficient. You need the book to read along, study grammar and expressions. We do not have yet an app except for Discord, where you can talk to our members.</p>

<h3>Interactive Learning</h3>

<p>Learning a language is so much more than just memorizing words; itâ€™s about connection! Engage with our community through regular quizzes on Discord and practice your skills with native speakers. We host public events and private one-on-one chat sessions to ensure you have plenty of opportunities to practice and make friends.</p>

<h3>Discord Community</h3>

<p>Maj School support an exchange community (intercambio) for learning foreign languages. We have set up chat rooms for each language where you can use voice and video to communicate with other members. We can talk about everything, but especially about learning a foreign language. You are invited to join us and start learning your favorite new language, or share your own language:</p>

<h2>Polyglot Resources</h2>

<p>We use Google docs to create "Maj Lexicon". This is a Polyglot dictionary of 8 languages. This document can be used to learn basic words for one of 8 languages we study. In this dictionary words are organized by length in different tabs. Short words first tab (W2), longer words next tabs (W3,W4,W5,W6). This dictionary is a primitive data resource for making an APP.<p>
