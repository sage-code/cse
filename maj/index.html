  <h2>Our Learning Method</h2>

  <p>Maj school offer a unique way to become polyglot without the need for a professor. With our resources, you can start learning today and continue at your own pace. Our method is fast, stress free, entertaining, and grounded in real-life communication. Participation to community allow you to make friends along the way without any commitment.</p>

  <h3>The Maj Alphabet Foundation</h3>
  <p>At the heart of our language learning journey is the Maj alphabet. We provide detailed explanations using the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) to ensure you grasp the sounds accurately. With accompanying sound recordings, you'll master pronunciation in no time! You can easily learn the Maj alphabet here on this website. We have posted audio recordings.</p>

  <h3>Flexible Learning Path</h3>

  <p>Every person is different and we learn in diferrent ways. Some people like to learn every day a little, some dedicate a lot of time and learn more intensively for several days then take a long break. No metter how you learn. You can read page by page a book or skip and jump from one resource to next. This is why we do not set a specific path. But at least learn the Maj alphabet first, how to read and write the letters.</p>

  <p>Once you've mastered the alphabet and pronounciation, then you can learn the Maj words and the expressions. Maj is the most easy to learn than any ohter secondary language. You can chose another language but will be much harder. The choise to learn Maj or another language belong to you and depends on your age and time you have to learn such a thing. Is going to be intense and challanging but I think worth your time, because knowing a second language will make you prowd! You prove that you can do the hard thing. Programming is much more easyer!!!</p>

  <h3>Comprehensive Vocabulary Building</h3>

  <p>We believe that vocabulary is vital to language mastery. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™ve curated a multilingual dictionary featuring the 5500 most common words. You can learn the words in 3 stages: beginner, intermediate, advanced words. Nouns and some other words you can learn visually, vizualizing pictures and reading the contextual examples. Other words you learn in expressions and short stories we make available on our books and web resources.</p>

  <h3>Interactive Learning Opportunities</h3>

  <p>Learning a language is so much more than just memorizing words; itâ€™s about connection! Engage with our community through regular quizzes on Discord and practice your skills with native speakers. We host public events and private one-on-one chat sessions to ensure you have plenty of opportunities to practice and make friends.</p>

  <h3>Accessible Resources</h3>
  <p>We want everyone to have access to our resources. Thatâ€™s why our books will be available on Kindle and PDF formats at an affordable price and even free. You can learn offline on your tablet without any distractions. We do not display ads. This means you can focus entirely on your language journey wherever you are!</p>

  <p>With our method, you can learn for years without costs. This is a sustainable, enjoyable option for lifelong learners. Plus, if you already know one of the secondary languages, you can contribute by teaching other members your own native language, fostering a rich community of shared knowledge.</p>

  <h2>Discord Community</h2>
  
  <p>Maj School is an exchange community (intercambio) for learning foreign languages. We have set up chat rooms for each language where you can use voice and video to communicate with other members. We can talk about everything, but especially about learning a foreign language and its culture. You are invited to join us and start learning Maj or any of the other languages we support:</p>
  
  <ul>

<h2><a id="lang-index"></a>Maj Documentation</h2>

<p>Next we will describe Maj language in details. We have the Maj School book that present grammar and introduce several words. However that is not nearly a complete Maj documentation. We have created an extensive Lexicon in for of Google Spreedsheet and Maj web documentation hosted on this website.<p>

<section>
<h3>Maj Dictionary</h3>

<p>We use Google docs to create Maj dictionary. This include translation of Maj in 6 languages. This dictionary can be used to learn any language not only Maj. In this dictionary words are organized by length. Short words first tab, longer words next tabs. Remember, learn shortest words first then longer words. Shorter words are more frequent.<p>

<p><b>Google spreedsheet:</b></p>

<ul>
<li><a href=
"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQIAx1UHDxg9SAk0caYU18U9hCQBfl-BWQuz9_6VhXwGr1aJdOfg-uv1ret-L-0u_2yQvPtlycNICi6/pubhtml?gid=341828124&single=true" >Maj Kora (Lexicon)</a></li>

<h3>External Tools</h3>

<p>We have created external tools for learning Maj language. You can use these tools to practice reading and writing. For now these tools are simplistic but we update them and keep them functional. We have plans to create our own tools, when the time is right. Until then, use these tools:
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://lingojam.com/EN-MajTranslator" target="_blank"
rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" >EN-Maj improvized translator</a></li>
<li><a href="https://lingojam.com/MajIPA" target="_blank"
rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" >Maj IPA phonetic converter</a></li>
</ul>
</section>

<p><b>Disclaim:</b> We appologies for the translator is so primitive. It uses a list of Maj words and it try to convert English to Maj. But of course do not know to invert word order or create expressions. Howecer will find some words for you to convert basic sentances. When a word is not found, the original word (Englis) is inserted in the translation. We use this tool ourselves and we improve it using synonims but will take time until gets better.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading about Maj School. Learn and prosper ðŸ¤Ÿ </p>
