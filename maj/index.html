  <h2>Our Learning Method</h2>

  <p>We offer a unique way to learn multiple languages without the need for a professor. With our resources, you can start learning today and continue at your own pace. Our method is fast, entertaining, and grounded in real-life communication, allowing you to make friends along the way without commitment or promises.</p>

  <h3>The Maj Alphabet Foundation</h3>
  <p>At the heart of our language learning journey is the Maj alphabet. We provide detailed explanations using the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) to ensure you grasp the sounds accurately. With accompanying sound recordings, you'll master pronunciation in no time! You can easily learn the Maj alphabet here on this website. We have posted audio recordings.</p>

  </div>

  <h3>Flexible Learning Path</h3>

  <p>Every person is different and we learn in diferrent ways. Some people like to learn every day a little, some dedicate a lor of time and learn intensively several days then take a long break. No metter how you learn. You can read page by page a book or skip and jump from one resource to next. This is why we do not set a specific path. But all the time you must learn the alphabet first.</p>

  <p>Once you've mastered the alphabet and pronounciation, then you can learn the words and the expressions. We make a suggestion to learn Maj first. This is more easy to learn than any ohter secondary language and you gain experience. You can chose another language. The choice is yours, and weâ€™re here to support you every step!</p>

  <h3>Comprehensive Vocabulary Building</h3>

  <p>We believe that vocabulary is vital to language mastery. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™ve curated a multilingual dictionary featuring the 5500 most common words. Some word comes with engaging pictures and contextual examples in multiple languages, making learning enjoyable and memorable for beginners.</p>

  <h3>Interactive Learning Opportunities</h3>

  <p>Learning a language is so much more than just memorizing words; itâ€™s about connection! Engage with our community through regular quizzes on Discord and practice your skills with native speakers in our chat rooms. We also host public events and private one-on-one sessions to ensure you have plenty of opportunities to practice and grow.</p>

  <h3>Accessible Resources</h3>
  <p>We want everyone to have access to our resources. Thatâ€™s why our books will be available on Kindle and PDF formats at an affordable price. You can learn offline on your tablet without any distractions. We do not display ads. This means you can focus entirely on your language journey wherever you are!</p>

  <p>With our method, you can learn for years without costs. This is a sustainable, enjoyable option for lifelong learners. Plus, if you already know one of the secondary languages, you can contribute by teaching other members your own native language, fostering a rich community of shared knowledge.</p>

<h2><a id="lang-index"></a>Maj Language</h2>

<p>Next we will describe Maj language in details. Maj is far more easy to learn compared to other languages. However this language is not yet spoken by anybody so you have to learn alone using our resources, until more Maj speakers will be able to have a conversation and exchange experience. Next document was created to introduce Maj language. Is a free document that you can read on-line:<p>

<section>
<h2>Maj Dictionary</h2>

<p>We use Google docs to create Maj dictionary. This include translation of Maj in 6 languages. This dictionary can be used to learn any language not only Maj. In this dictionary words are organized by length. Short words first tab, longer words next tabs. Remember, learn shortest words first then longer words. Shorter words are more frequent.<p>

<h2>External Tools</h2>

<p>We have created external tools for learning Maj language. You can use these tools to practice reading and writing. For now these tools are simplistic but we update them and keep them functional. We have plans to create our own tools, when the time is right. Until then, use these tools:
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://lingojam.com/EN-MajTranslator" target="_blank"
rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" >EN-Maj improvized translator</a></li>
<li><a href="https://lingojam.com/MajIPA" target="_blank"
rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" >Maj IPA phonetic converter</a></li>
</ul>
</section>

<p><b>Disclaim:</b> We appologies for the translator is so primitive. It uses a list of Maj words and it try to convert English to Maj. But of course do not know to invert word order or create expressions. Howecer will find some words for you to convert basic sentances. When a word is not found, the original word (Englis) is inserted in the translation. We use this tool ourselves and we improve it using synonims but will take time until gets better.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading about Maj School. Learn and prosper ðŸ¤Ÿ </p>
