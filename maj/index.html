  <h3>Flexible Learning Paths</h3>
  <p>Once you've mastered the Maj alphabet, the world of Romance languages opens up to you! Whether you choose to focus on one language at a time or dive into multiple languages simultaneously, our method is designed to fit your unique learning style. The choice is yours, and weâ€™re here to support you every step of the way!</p>

  <h3>Comprehensive Vocabulary Building</h3>
  <p>We believe that vocabulary is vital to language mastery. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™ve curated a multilingual dictionary featuring the 5,000 most common words. Each word comes with engaging pictures and contextual examples in multiple languages, making learning enjoyable and memorable. Plus, with pronunciation expressed in Maj and accompanied by audio recordings, youâ€™ll feel confident speaking from day one!</p>

  <h3>Interactive Learning Opportunities</h3>
  <p>Learning a language is so much more than just memorizing words; itâ€™s about connection! Engage with our community through regular quizzes on Discord and practice your skills with native speakers in our chat rooms. We also host public events and private one-on-one sessions to ensure you have plenty of opportunities to practice and grow.</p>

  <h3>Accessible Resources</h3>
  <p>We want everyone to have access to our resources. Thatâ€™s why our book, "Romance Languages: Polyglot Without a Professor," is available on Kindle and PDF formats at an affordable price.

  <h2>Discord Community</h2>
  
  <p>Maj School is an exchange community (intercambio) for learning foreign languages. We have set up chat rooms for each language where you can use voice and video to communicate with other members. We can talk about everything, but especially about learning a foreign language and its culture. You are invited to join us and start learning Maj or any of the other languages we support:</p>
  
  <ul>
      <li>[ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¾]English</li>
      <li>[ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸]Spanish</li>
      <li>[ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·]French</li>
      <li>[ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹]Italian</li>
      <li>[ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡´]Romanian</li>
      <li>[ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª]German</li>
      <li>[ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º]Russian</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Maj is inspired by these languages; we have borrowed the shortest words and "majified" them to create a beautiful lexicon. You can learn how to chat using Maj words. We use the Maj Latin alphabet for chatting, which does not include any accents or diacritics, making it easy to type on a standard US keyboard. Additionally, Maj has a secondary script alphabet inspired by Georgian letters, allowing you to create secret messages using both Maj Script and the Maj Language. Since Maj is not yet a widely known language and its script is difficult to learn, AI will not recognize this language for a long time. You can use Maj to take secret notes that will not be easy to decipher. Click the link below to join our community:</p>

<h2><a id="lang-index"></a>Maj Language</h2>

<p>Next we will describe Maj language in details. Maj should be more easy to learn compared to other languages but it will require many hours of study because it has a relative large and rich vocabulary (5000 words). This language is not yet spoken by anybody except the author. Next document was created to introduce Maj language to young learners. Is a free document that you can read on-line:<p>

<p>Maj design was started in 2020. Since then we have created a dictionary and basic grammar book. Our dictionary has about 5000 words and expressions. We will ocasionaly create new words and we create examples to learn the language from short text articles and stories. The language is stabile and comprehensive. We will however probably change some words over time to improve the language flow.</a>

<h2>Maj Dictionary</h2>

<p>We use Google docs to create a dictionary. This include translation of Maj in 6 languages. In the future we will create a database and a translation form and translation APP. For now these spreedsheets is all we have. So far Maj has basic words.<p>

<p><b>Google spreedsheet:</b></p>

<ul>
<li><a href=
"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQIAx1UHDxg9SAk0caYU18U9hCQBfl-BWQuz9_6VhXwGr1aJdOfg-uv1ret-L-0u_2yQvPtlycNICi6/pubhtml?gid=341828124&single=true" >Maj Kora (Lexicon)</a></li>

<h2>External Tools</h2>

<p>We have created external tools for learning Maj language. You can use these tools to practice reading and writing. For now these tools are simplistic but we update them and keep them functional. We have plans to create our own tools when the time is right. Until then, use these tools:
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://lingojam.com/EN-MajTranslator" target="_blank"
rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" >EN-Maj improvized translator</a></li>
<li><a href="https://lingojam.com/MajIPA" target="_blank"
rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" >Maj IPA phonetic converter</a></li>
</ul>
</section>

<p><b>Disclaim:</b> We appologies for the translator is not perfect. It uses a list of words and it try to convert English to Maj. But of course do not know to invert word order and is poorly made. Howecer will find some words for you to convert basic expressions. We use this tool ourselves and we improve it using synonims so more words can be converted, however it will remain a primitive tool for a while.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading about Maj School. Learn and prosper ðŸ¤Ÿ </p>
