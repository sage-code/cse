<h1>Maj Alphabet</h1>

<div class="alert alert-secondary">Maj has an alphabet derived from ISO Latin. It has 26 letters associated with 30 sounds. The language has a balanced consonant-to-vowel ratio of 3:1 (21 consonants to 7 vowels). We avoid consonat clusters and we use simple word patterns to make Maj words easier to pronounce. Recently we have reintroduced W and Q to keep Maj alphabet compatible with English. Because now you can  represents all English sounds.</div>

</div>

<p><strong>Notes:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Each letter has an uppercase version;</li>
<li>We use "W" like a soft "U" that can't get accent;</li>
<li>We use "Q" with "w" or "u" after it always and is pronounced /kw/ or /ku/;</li>
</ul>

<h2>Maj Script</h2>

<p>Maj script is created by reusing Unicode letters from numerous alphabets including Lating, Greek and Georgian. Each letter is design to be created from a single pen stroak. Maj script is written with a pen or a stylus, using a continuous coursive line.</p>

<p>Maj script letters have round portions, sharp angles and returns. You must learn where to start a letter and go ahead in a single direction until you finish the letter. Between letters there is a short distance. Between words, the distance is larger, at least double, to distinguish the independent words. </p>

<h2>Pronunciation guide </h2>

<p>Maj pronunciation is based on deterministic rules. That means, pronounciation rules are the same in all words and do not depend on the word origin. In Maj you do no need to learn how to spell words. That is if you know Maj alphabet and reading rules then you can read any Maj word correctly even if you have never heared that word before.</p>

<h4>Notes</h4>

<ul>
<li>Maj alphabet has 7 vowels, 19 consonants and 4 digraphs in total 30 sounds;</li>
<li>Maj sounds require healthy tongue, lips, teeth and vocal chords;</li>
<li>Maj sounds do not require to put your tongue between your teeth;</li>
<li>Maj sounds do not require inverted tongue tip (retroflex);</li>
<li>Maj has strong consonants and clear vowels similar to Portuguese;</li>
<li>Maj sounds have a Balkanic influence, though not all sounds are derived from Latin.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Modified Letters:</strong></p>

<hr>
<ol class="fixed">
<li>"h" is read /ə/ like "eo" in word "pigeon";</li>
<li>"j" is read /ʒ/ like "su" in word "pleasure";</li>
<li>"x" is read /h/ like "ho" in word "hollywood";</li>
<li>"c" is read /ʃ/ like "sh" in word "sheep";</li>
</ol>

</ul>

<h2>Vowels</h2>

<p>Maj has 7 vowels: { a, e, i, o, u } and two semivowels { h, y }:</p>

  <p>Maj Vowels</p>
</div> 

<h4>Pronounciation</h4>

<p>Vowels are pronounced like in Italian and Romanian languages not like in English nor German:</p>

<hr>
<ul class="fixed">
<li>"a" read /a/ is open central, like "a" in "car";</li>
<li>"e" read /e/ is close-mid front, like "e" in "melon";</li>
<li>"i" read /i/ is close front, like "ee" in "geese";</li>
<li>"o" read /o/ is close-mid back, like "o" in "document";</li>
<li>"u" read /u/ is close back, like "oo" in "soon";</li>
<li>"y" read /y/ is very similar to sound "i" in words "still"</li>
<li>"h" read /ə/ is mid central, like "o" in baron;</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<h4>Voice Recording</h4>

<p>Listen and learn vowel pronounciation in order:</p>
<div class="center">
  <audio controls>
    <source src="/maj/audio/vowels.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
    Your browser does not support audio.
  </audio>
  <p>{ a, e, i, o, u, y, h } </p>
</div>

<p><strong>Letter "y":</strong>Is close central, un-rounded vowel. IPA symbol for this sound is actually /y/. This sound is very different than English sound "y". It is very similar to sound "i" in words "still" or "director". A similar sound is IPA:/ɨ/. Maj do not use this letter very often but it is present in some words given as examples: "myna" = hand and "zyna" = fairy.</p>

<p>Learn more: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_front_rounded_vowel">listening: y</a></p>

<p><strong>Letter "h":</strong>In Maj this letter is very different from other languages. This letter is pronounced "ə" and is never silent. If it is present, it has to be read. Th original letter h is replaced by letter x or X. So then letter X si pronounced IPA: /h/.</p>
<p>Since on QUERTY KEYBOARD there is not letter "ə" we have decided to use "h" instead. We have inspired this decision from Greek where H is actually pronounced "i" but we think "ə" is necesary since we do have "i" that is good enaugh. Also there is no point to have a silent letters in Maj so "h" ould be wasted.</p>

<h2>Diphthongs</h2>
<p>A diphthong is a new sound created with two vowels. Maj has numerous diphthongs. In the next table you can find all theoretica possible diphthongs: (42) in practice, some diphtongs will never be used due to difficult pronounciation.</p>

  <p>Maj Diphtongs</p>
</div>

<p><br/><strong>Note: </strong>In maj some diphtongs are gliding. This technique may be difficult to learn but listening to audio recording will help. Maj is made for typing fast more than speaking. Does not matter if your pronunciation is not perfect. Words must sound distinct and pronounciation will be tricky until you get profficient in Maj.</p>


<h2>Tone and accent</h2>

<p>Maj is designed for chat, so it has no official tone. When can be read with a monotone voice by a robot and this is fine. It is not wrong to use tone to improve the meaning of long statements, enumerations, queries or exclamative sentences but this is unusual and characteristic to humans that have a native tonal language. Maj do not require use of any tonal or accent for speaking the words. Accent on first or second vowel will just do ok. However we do not put the accent on the last vowel.</p>

<h2>Consonants</h2>
<p>Maj is using 17 consonants from standard Latin alphabet:</p>

</div>

<h4>Pronounciation</h4>

<p>Most consonants are similar to IPA but some are different;</p>
<hr>
<hr>
<ul class="fixed">
<li>"b" is voiced, plosive, bilabial like "b" in "boss";</li>
<li>"c" is voiceless, post-alveolar fricative like "sh" in "fashion";</li>
<li>"p" is voiceless, plosive, bilabial like "p" in "pin";</li>
<li>"t" is voiceless, plosive, alveolar like "t" in "test";</li>
<li>"d" is voiced, plosive, alveolar like "d" in "door";</li>
<li>"k" is voiceless velar stop like "k" in "kitten" or "c" in "color";</li>
<li>"m" is nasal, bilabial, like "m" in "mule";</li>
<li>"n" is alveolar, nasal, like "n" in "novel";</li>
<li>"r" is trilled, similar to sound "r" in Spanish "perro";</li>
<li>"f" is voiceless, labio-dental fricative like "f" in "frog";</li>
<li>"v" is voiced labio-dental fricative, similar to "v" in "voice";</li>
<li>"s" is fricative alveolar like "s" in "snake";</li>
<li>"z" is alveolar-dental, vibrated, similar to "z" in "zoo";</li>
<li>"l" is liquid, alveolar, like "l" in "lord";</li>
<li>"g" is voiced velar fricative like "gu" in "guitar";</li>
<li>"j" is voiced fricative alveolar, like "s" in "pleasure";</li>
<li>"x" is voiced fricative glottal like "h" in "happy";</li>
</ul>

<h2>Digraphs</h2>
<p>Digraphs are groups of 2 letters that are thigtly connected and become a new and distinctive sound. In fact we have created special script letters for these 3 sounds. In other languages one vowel and one consonant can make a digraph but in Maj digraphs are created using two consonants.</p>

<table class="table table-border table-striped">
<tr><th>DIGRAPH</th><th>LC</th><th> IPA</th></tr>
<tr><td>Tc</td><td> tc</td><td> /t͡ʃ]</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ts</td><td> ts</td><td> /t͡s]</td></tr>
<tr><td>Dj</td><td> dj</td><td> /d͡ʒ]</td></tr>
<tr><td>Gn</td><td> gn</td><td> /ŋ]</td></tr>
</table>

<h4>Digraph Pronunciation</h4>

<ul>
<li>Digraph "tc" sounds "t͡ʃ" like "ch" in "peach"</li>
<li>Digraph "ts" sounds "t͡s" like "ts" in "cats"</li>
<li>Group "dj" sounds "d͡ʒ" like "g" in "giraffe"</li>
<li>Cluster "gn" is read /ŋ/ similar to "gn" in Italian word "signora";</li>
</ul>

<h2>Consonant Clusters</h2>
<p>A cluster represents a group of two consonants. Maj is using clusters in many words using the pattern: CCV or VCCV.</p>
<p><strong>Rules:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We do not use the same letter twice to make clusters;</li>
<li>Clusters of 3 consonants are extremely rare in Maj;</li>
<li>Some combinations cannot be pronounced, therefore are discouraged;</li>
</ul>

<h3>Examples:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>group "tz", is actually "ts" (more realistic)</li>
  <li>group "sd", is actually "st", making "d" after s is too hard</li>
  <li>group "dz", is not used but group "zd" can be easy used</li>
  <li>group "pz", is hard to use so we preffer "ps" instead</li>
  <li>...there is no point to identify them all now</li>
</ul>
