<h1>Maj Project</h1>

<p>Maj project is open source and it has distributed content in two repositories. This page is part of Sage-Code CSE project. CSE is a large documentation project that include web tutorials for software engineering and several other languages alongside Maj. Though Maj is not a programming language per say, is an artifficial language nevertheless. We create several other artifficial languages similar to Maj. The Bee and the Eve, are two programming language we have designed. We host them together in common CSE repository.</p>

<h4>GitHub Repository</h4>

<p>You can check CSE and MAJ repositories on the project page. As a Sage-Code developer you can contribute to our projects directly without forking. All details are available on read.me files for contributors. Check our projects page and make a clone for further research. This is a great opportunity to keep track of changes and use our content offline:</p>

<h2>Reasons</h2>

<p>There are some good reasons to make a new and different language:</p>

<ul>
<li>Erosion of linguistic diversity has reduced the number of languages to around 6,500;</li>
<li>Languages become more complex as time pass and therefore difficult to learn;</li>
<li>Languages are difficult to optimize due to government intervention and static culture;</li>
<li>Languages have errors that nobody care to fix that makes some of them ambiguous;</li>
<li>Languages progress is real slow, lagging behind scientific and technologic descoveries.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Purpose:</h2>

<p>Maj language has several potential use-cases:</p>

<ol>
<li>playground for creative software in language processing and games;</li>
<li>learning how to use tools to organize a large and chelenging project;</li>
<li>study grammar and vocabulary of other languages like French, Spanish and Italian;</li>
<li>experiment with different words and sounds comming from other languages;</li>
</ol>

<h2>Attributes:</h2>

<p>Maj language, will have the following attributes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Regular      - with deterministic reading rules;</li>
<li>Efficient    - short words and simple grammar;</li>
<li>Innovative   - logic and comprehensive;</li>
</ul>


<h3>Regular</h3>

<p>Maj have shorte words to reduce cost of typing; so Maj can be faster and more efficient than other languages; after initial calculation we estimate Maj is on average 20% more efficient than other languages. Also we try to make Maj more efficient by reducing number of words required in sentances; therefore Maj has an unusually large number of verbs.</p>

<p><strong>Rules:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Maj frequent words are shorter while less frequent words are longer;</li>
<li>Maj can use prefixes and suffixes to make a new word from a root;</li>
<li>Maj letters are pronounced the same in all words regardless of word origin;</li>
</ul>

<h3>Efficient</h3>

<p>We strive to make Maj efficient. Our main method is to make short words. We aim for Maj to be crisp and elegant easy to pronounce. We avoid long clasters of consonants (3 or more consonants) butwe use sometimes two consonants side by side, and make words shorter.</p>

<p>Many words are related in Maj by using a common root with different ending vowel: {"a", "e", "o", "u", "h", "i"} to create groups of related words. In the next example you can see a regular noun and a regular verb.</p>

<p><strong>Regular Noun:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>poma = fruit </li>
<li>pome = fruits</li>
<li>pomo = fruitful</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Verb example:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>doza = dizziness</li>
<li>dozo = dizzy</li>
<li>dozu = getting dizzy</li>
</ul>

<p>This verb can change the status of something or somebody. The new status becomes an adjective. Also this verb ce infer a new abstract thing called "doza". And this can be used as a noun. Maj is rigid, do not use other forms. If we need another form for a rout we may add more letters</p>

<h3>Experimental:</h3>

<p>Maj is experimental and not perfect. In our defense it was created simple on purpose to be logic and easy to learn. One major issue of Maj is the high similarity between two short words. Sometimes words that have nothing in common may look alike, having just a vowel difference. We try to identify these situations by creating longer words.</p>

<h4>Examples:</h4>
<ul>
<li>rota = wheel</li>
<li>ruta = route</li>
</ul>

<p>One single letter can be read wrong and this can change the meaning of the sentence. Maj is not error tolerant and this is bad because we can not use error correction algorithms. There will be no spell check for Maj. You must be careful to type it correctly.</p>


<p>Maj is a worm-up language. Once you have learned Maj you can teach or learn any other language more easly, using Maj as an intermediary language. Not everyone knows English. Some people know onlu native languages. We will create resources to learn Maj using pictures. That is our long term goal for Maj project. We want to make Maj the refference langauage. This is hard work and we need your help to do it.</p>

<p>Let's continue Maj study with the Alphabet and writing symbols.</p>
