<h2>Data Visualization</h2>

<div class="alert alert-secondary shadow-sm">
Data visualization is the graphical representation of data. It is a powerful tool that can be used to communicate insights from data in a way that is easy to understand. Data visualizations help analysts, researchers and business leaders make better data-driven decisions.
</div>

<h3>Use Cases</h3>

<p>Here is a list of possible use-cases where data visualizationn can be useful.</p>

<ul>
<li>Identifying trends and outliers in business data</li>
<li>Comparing metrics over time</li>
<li>Visualizing relationships between variables</li>  
<li>Communicating insights and findings to stakeholders</li>
<li>Exploring data to explain fenomens make predictions or find opportunities</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some examples of how data visualization is used in computer science:</p>
<ul>
<li>A data scientist uses data visualization to identify patterns in customer behavior.</li>
<li>A software engineer uses data visualization to validate the output of a machine learning model.</li>
<li>A game developer uses data visualization to track player engagement.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Diagrams</h3>

<p>Common data visualization diagrams include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bar charts</li>
<li>Line charts</li> 
<li>Pie charts</li>
<li>Scatter plots</li>
<li>Maps</li>
<li>Heat maps</li>
<li>Tree maps</li>
<li>Network graphs</li>
</ul>

<h2>Visualization Style</h2>

<p>Dynamic and static data visualization are two types of data visualization that differ in how they interact with the data.</p>

<p>Dynamic data visualization is interactive, meaning that the user can interact with the visualization to change the way it looks. This can be done by clicking on different parts of the visualization, or by dragging and dropping elements. Dynamic data visualization is often used to explore data and to identify patterns and trends.</p>

<p>Static data visualization is non-interactive, meaning that the user cannot change the way it looks. Static data visualization is often used to communicate insights from data to a wider audience.</p>

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-dark">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Feature</th>
<th>Dynamic data visualization</th>
<th>Static data visualization</th>

<td>Communicating insights from data to a wider audience</td>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>The best type of data visualization to use depends on the specific needs of the user. If the user needs to explore data and identify patterns and trends, then dynamic data visualization is a good choice. If the user needs to communicate insights from data to a wider audience, then static data visualization is a good choice.</p>

<p>Here are some examples of dynamic data visualization:</p>
<ul>
<li>A website that allows users to explore historical weather data by dragging and dropping a slider to change the date.</li>
<li>A mobile app that allows users to track their fitness data and see how it changes over time.</li>
<li>A financial trading platform that allows users to see how different stocks are performing in real time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some examples of static data visualization:</p>
<ul>
<li>An infographic that shows the demographics of a population.</li>
<li>A dashboard that shows the performance of a company's sales team.</li>
<li>A map that shows the distribution of a disease.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Applications</h2>

<p>Custom-built applications for data visualization are used in different companies to help them make better decisions, identify trends, and improve their bottom line. These applications can be used to visualize data from a variety of sources, including databases, spreadsheets, and web APIs. They can also be used to create interactive visualizations that allow users to drill down into the data and explore it in more detail.</p>

<p>Some of the benefits of using custom-built applications for data visualization include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flexibility: Custom-built applications can be tailored to the specific needs of the company, which means that they can be used to visualize data in a way that is most meaningful to the users.</li>
<li>Power: Custom-built applications can be used to visualize large datasets and complex relationships. This can help companies to identify trends and patterns that would not be possible to see with other visualization tools.</li>
<li>Scalability: Custom-built applications can be scaled to handle large datasets and increasing user traffic. This means that they can be used by companies of all sizes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of the companies that use custom-built applications for data visualization include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google</li>
<li>Netflix</li>
<li>Amazon</li>
</ul>

<p>Custom-built applications for data visualization can be a valuable tool for companies of all sizes. By providing a flexible, powerful, and scalable way to visualize data, these applications can help companies to make better decisions, identify trends, and improve their bottom line.</p>

<p>Here are some examples of custom-built applications for data visualization:</p>
<ul>
<li>A social media analytics application that visualizes data about user engagement, demographics, and content popularity.</li>
<li>A financial trading application that visualizes data about market trends, historical prices, and trading activity.</li>
<li>A healthcare analytics application that visualizes data about patient demographics, treatment outcomes, and clinical trials.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are just a few examples of the many ways that custom-built applications for data visualization can be used. By understanding the specific needs of your company, you can create custom applications that will help you to achieve your business goals.</p>

<h2>Existing Tools</h2>

<p>Excel and Google Docs are both powerful tools that can be used to create data visualizations for smaller datasets. They offer a variety of chart and graph types, as well as the ability to customize the look and feel of your visualizations.</p>
<p>Here are some of the steps involved in creating data visualizations in Excel or Google Docs:</p>
<ol>
<li>Import your data into the spreadsheet.</li>
<li>Select the data you want to visualize.</li>
<li>Choose a chart or graph type.</li>
<li>Customize the look and feel of your visualization.</li>
<li>Save your visualization.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here are some examples of data visualizations that can be created in Excel or Google Docs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bar charts: Bar charts are a good way to visualize categorical data. They can be used to show the frequency of different categories, or to compare the values of different categories.</li>
<li>Line charts: Line charts are a good way to visualize trends over time. They can be used to show how a value changes over time, or to compare the values of different variables over time.</li>
<li>Pie charts: Pie charts are a good way to visualize the parts of a whole. They can be used to show the percentage of a total that is made up of different categories.</li>
</ul>
<p>Excel and Google Docs are both great tools for creating data visualizations for smaller datasets. However, they can be limited when working with larger datasets. This is because they can be slow to load and manipulate large datasets, and they may not have the features you need to create complex visualizations.</p>
<p>If you are working with a large dataset, you may want to use a dedicated data visualization tool. These tools are designed to handle large datasets, and they offer a wider range of features than Excel or Google Docs. Some popular data visualization tools include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tableau</li>
<li>Qlik</li>
<li>Microsoft Power BI</li>
<li>D3.js</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a few of the many data visualization tools that are available. The best tool for you will depend on your specific needs and preferences.</p>

<p>The best tool for you will depend on your specific needs and preferences. If you are looking for a user-friendly tool that is easy to learn, then Tableau or Qlik may be a good choice for you. If you need a tool that can handle large datasets, then Qlik may be a good choice. If you are looking for a powerful tool that can be used to create complex visualizations, then D3.js may be a good choice. If you are using Python for data analysis, then Matplotlib may be a good choice.</p>
