# Project: SageCode.pro
This is a static professional website built with HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap 5. It is hosted and deployed on Vercel.

## Tech Stack & Environment
- **Framework:** Bootstrap 5 (using CDN or local files)
- **Deployment:** Vercel (Automatic deployments via GitHub)
- **Structure:** Standard static HTML (index.html, about.html, etc.)
- **Styling:** Custom CSS located in `/sage.css`

## Coding Guidelines
- **Mobile First:** Always use Bootstrap's responsive grid (container, row, col) and utility classes (d-flex, mt-3, etc.).
- **Clean HTML:** Maintain semantic HTML5 tags (<header>, <main>, <footer>).
- **CSS:** Avoid inline styles. Put all custom overrides in `sage.css`.
- **Performance:** Use optimized images and minimize heavy JavaScript.


## Specific Project Rules
- **Tone:** The website should feel professional, technical, and educational.
- **Vercel Optimization:** Ensure all file paths are relative and work correctly on Vercel's production environment.
- **Assets:** Store images in the `/images/` and videos in the `/videos/` folders.
- **Readable HTML:** Reduce deep indentation for HTML, keep HTML simple and readable.

## Current Goals
- Improve content, beginner friendly simple english.
- Bring content style to standard content used in /engineering.html /engineering/concepts.html
- Detect and fix broken links.
