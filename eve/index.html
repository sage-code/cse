<h1>What is EVE?</h1>

<div class="alert alert-secondary shadow-sm">Eve is a modern, declarative 4th generation scripting language designed as the successor to an earlier language called Level, which was developed in 2002. While the Level project has been discontinued, Eve aims to build upon the lessons learned and provide a more feature-rich, comprehensible, and accessible language. With a focus on improved developer productivity, Eve combines a familiar yet explicit syntax with modular design principles, making it well-suited for data manipulation tasks across various domains, including text, binary data, and database connectivity. </div>

<p>My inspiration for the name Eve comes from the heartwarming movie WALL-E.  In the film, Eve is a sleek, high-tech robot who can soar through the air.  She forms an unlikely bond with WALL-E, a kind-hearted but older trash compactor robot.  Together, this adorable pair embarks on exciting adventures in space, ultimately playing a crucial role in humanity's future.  If you search "WALL-E robots" on YouTube, you'll find plenty of clips showcasing their journey.  While Eve possesses impressive speed and advanced technology, she's also driven by a strong sense of purpose and harbors a surprising depth of emotion.</p>

<h2>EVE Features</h2>

<p>Eve empowers efficient data handling within the EVE environment. It excels at seamlessly transferring data between internal databases and external files. This includes both importing data from external sources and exporting data from databases for external use.</p>
<p>Eve offers a range of advanced features to optimize your data management experience:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Data compression:</strong> Reduces file sizes for efficient storage and transmission.</li>
  <li><strong>Database synchronization:</strong> Establishes bi-directional connections to keep multiple databases in sync.</li>
  <li><strong>Data curation:</strong> Cleanses and organizes data to ensure its accuracy and consistency.</li>
  <li><strong>Data encryption:</strong> Safeguards sensitive information during transfers and storage.</li>
  <li><strong>Database archiving and restoration:</strong> Enables efficient backups and recovery of large databases.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Eve Scripting</h2>

<p>EVE enable it's users to tailor bussiness processes using a scripting language called Eve. Next we describe Eve syntax in details using examples. We organize the pages in logical order from basic to advanced. Each page has top bookmarks for most important titles. You can use them to jump to a specific topic. We are working hard to improve the desjgn of this language.</p>

<div class="alert alert-warning"><span style="color:brown">Disclaim:&nbsp;</span> In this documentation sometimes we refer to Eve using perfect tense like it is already realized, but EVE is not yet available. This reference document can serve as a high level design and initial tutorial to learn the language syntax and semantics. It will be improved over time and we will fix the grammar using AI.</div>

<h2>Eve Compiler</h2>

<p>Is a tradition in computer science to create BNF for a new language. This tutorial has described the language but is not a specification for the compiler. To create a compiler for Eve we will desgin BNF specification. We will create BNF using AI.</p>

<div class="alert alert-info">BNF: or Backus-Naur Form, is a notation technique used to describe the syntax of programming languages, computer file formats, and other formal language specifications. It provides a formal way to define the grammar rules that govern the structure of valid statements or expressions in a language.</div>

<p>Eve BNF is not yet available. We have started a project on GitHub that will host BNF specification, code examples, test cases and code required to build EVE. For this effort we need sponsors to incentivise our core team. Until we have a sponsor, we can work on open source compiler in our free time. We are looking for volunteers.</p>

<h2>Prep Quiz</h2>

<div class="alert alert-secondary shadow-sm">
  We have a quiz of 100 questions for beginners to check on Eve syntax. You can scan the code using a mobile or tablet. If you are already on mobile device, tap the code below to start the quiz. It requires you to sign-in using your Google account. Good luck!

  </div>
  
  <p><b>Certificate: </b>If you take the quiz with 80% or more we recognize you as Sage-Code developer. You can claim a certificate of completion. Wen the EVE compiler will be available you will be able to contribute with EVE code and teach other people EVE language. Tell your friends about your new skills and join our core team.</p>
