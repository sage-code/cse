E
Is the creation of closure peculiar with let keyword? Should I use new instead?

Edit
No, the creation of closures in Eve is not done using the let keyword. You should use the new keyword to create a new closure instance.

In Eve, closures are created by having a function (often called the "higher-order function") return another function (the closure) that has access to variables from the outer function's scope.

Here's an example:

eve

Copy
driver closure_example:

function outer_function(x: Integer) => (@inner_function: Function):
  let y = 10 # This is a variable from the outer scope

  let inner_function := Function() => (@result: Integer):
    # The inner function (closure) can access 'y' from the outer scope
    let result := x + y
  return

process:
  let closure_instance = outer_function(5) # Create a new closure instance
  print closure_instance() # Output: 15
return
In this example, outer_function returns a new function inner_function, which is a closure because it has access to the variable y from the outer scope. When we create a new instance of this closure using new closure_instance := outer_function(5), the value of x is bound to 5, and the closure retains access to the value of y (which is 10).

So, to create a new closure instance, you should use the new keyword, followed by the assignment operator := and the call to the higher-order function that returns the closure.

E
can a routine be executed asynchronously?

Edit
Yes, a routine in Eve can be executed asynchronously using the "run" keyword. This allows the routine to run in a separate thread or coroutine, while the main process continues execution without waiting for the routine to complete.

Here's an example:

eve

Copy
driver async_routine_demo:

routine long_running_task():
  # Simulating a long-running task
  wait 5000ms
  print "Long-running task completed"
return

process:
  print "Starting main process"

  # Execute the routine asynchronously
  run long_running_task()

  print "Main process continues execution"

  # Wait for the user to press Enter to exit
  read
return
In this example, long_running_task is a routine that simulates a long-running task by waiting for 5 seconds. In the process block, we first print a message indicating that the main process has started. Then, we use the run keyword to execute long_running_task asynchronously.

After executing the routine asynchronously, the main process continues execution by printing "Main process continues execution". The program then waits for the user to press Enter before exiting, allowing the asynchronous routine to complete in the background.

If you want to execute a routine synchronously (i.e., wait for it to complete before continuing the main process), you can use the call keyword instead of run.

By allowing routines to be executed asynchronously, Eve provides a mechanism for concurrent execution and non-blocking operations, which can be useful in various scenarios, such as handling long-running tasks or performing parallel computations.

"call" (Correct Answer)
"start"
"yield" (Incorrect)
What happens when a process or coroutine encounters the "yield all" statement in Eve?
It waits for all other coroutines and processes to complete before continuing (Correct Answer)
It terminates all other coroutines and processes
It creates a new coroutine
It interrupts the current process or coroutine (Incorrect)
Can a coroutine in Eve call another coroutine?
Yes (Correct Answer)
No

Which keyword is used to interrupt the current process or coroutine in Eve?
"halt" (Correct Answer)
"stop"
"exit"
"yield" (Incorrect)
Can a routine in Eve be executed asynchronously and synchronously within the same process?
Yes (Correct Answer)
No

To interrupt the current process (Incorrect)
Can a coroutine in Eve raise an exception?
Yes (Correct Answer)
No
Only if the exception is caught in the main process

What is the difference between "start" and "run" keywords in Eve?
"start" executes a coroutine or routine asynchronously, while "run" executes it synchronously (Correct Answer)
There is no difference; they are interchangeable
"start" creates a new coroutine, while "run" executes an existing one
"start" executes a routine, while "run" executes a coroutine (Incorrect)
Can a coroutine in Eve access variables from the parent process or coroutine?
Yes, if the variables are declared as global (Correct Answer)
No, coroutines have their own isolated scope
Only if the coroutine is executed synchronously
Only if the variables are passed as arguments to the coroutine (Incorrect)
