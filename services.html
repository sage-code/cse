<h1>Sage-Code Services</h1>

<div class="alert alert-secondary shadow-sm">At Sage-Code, we offer premium resources to elevate your skills and showcase your achievements. To keep our platform private and ad-free, we use a simple, third-party service for our low-cost monthly subscription. This ensures you get secure access to our digital products and commissions without the need for a traditional shopping cart or registration.
</div>


<h2>Subscription Levels</h2>

<p>
While our open Discord server is a place for free community support, a premium membership offers a focused path to mastery. As a subscriber, you'll gain access to exclusive tools and resources like pre-recorded video lessons, printable digital books, and downloadable code snippets. You can choose from one of three tiers: @Student, @Developer, or @Sponsor,to get the support you need. To ensure a high-quality experience for every member, we cap our community at 100 members, and will close new enrollments once that limit is reached.
</p>

<h2 class="text-center">Choose Your Membership Tier</h2>
<p class="text-center">This is a promotion for 100 members. First come first served!</p>

<h3>Amazon Book Pricing</h3>

<p>You might have seen some of our books are listed at a higher price on Amazon. This is due to their high printing costs, which leave very little for the author.  Kindle books are less expensive but you can't write on a digital book. So for working books where you must write on the book, and high photo quality book, that is the only sollution we have to print higher quality books.</p>

<h3>Ko-Fi Book Pricing</h3>
<p>Our mission is to bypass Amazon's expensive business model and give you better value while keeping our work sustainable. That's why we distribute our books as PDF or MP4 on the Ko-Fi shop. This business model allows us to provide you with better quality, free updates, various digital formats, and low prices or pay what you want.</p>

<hr>
<h3>PayPal Contribution</h3>
<div class="alert alert-info">
    <p>You know our community supports 100 members in each role. When our 300-member limit is reached, you can still support our mission and get premium benefits. A one-time annual contribution of $10 on PayPal grants you a @special role in our Discord community. For each $10 contribution, you receive 2 hours of one-on-one mentoring, plus access to mentoring channels like any @student. This contribution model does not give you additional access to Ko-Fi shop free books; it is just for the Discord role.</p>
