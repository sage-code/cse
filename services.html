<h3><a id="git">Project Repository</a></h3>

<p>We use GitHub for version control. Most of our projects are under <a href="https://github.com/sage-code">SageCode</a> organization. Every member can have it's own projects hosted under his own account. We manage only common projects under Sage-Code and not individual projects. However we can contribute to your project from time to time and make pull requests that you will moderate. If we host your project under SageCode umbrela, then we manage the pull requests ourselves.</p>

<h3><a id="host">Project Hosting</a></h3>  

<p><a href="https://vercel.com">Vercel</a> is a strong option for project hosting if you prioritize speed, security, and ease of use.  Their "Frontend Cloud" platform streamlines deployment and integrates with popular Git providers.  This allows you to focus on development while Vercel handles infrastructure and global content delivery for a fast user experience.  Plus, their automatic scaling and built-in security features ensure your project stays up and running smoothly.
</p>

<h3><a id="storage">Data Storage</a></h3>

<p>We use internet services to create and manage PostgreSQL databases. One of our favorite provider: <a href="https://neon.tech/">Neon</a> provide free and payed subscription for hosting your database. We will use this service to create and manage our own serverless databases</p>

<p>We preffer to use PostgreSQL over other databases for it's reach features and low price. As you know PostgreSQL is open source and is a hybrid database. We know how to laverage stored procedures using pgSQL and how to optimize structure of these databases for highest performance.</p>

<h2 id="sponsor">Project</h2>

<p>We have registered our own projects. You can participate to our projects, existing projects of other members or you can create your own new project. If you have your own project you are a "project owner". This give you great control but also responsability. You then can ask for sponsors or help on our community.</p>

<p>How to become a Sage-Code project owner: First you need a Discord account. Then you can make a donation of 10$ to Sage-Code. After this we advice our members to follow you. This is a great opportunity to promote yourself among our members. Then you can have a Twitch account where your followers donate bits to reward your streaming activity.</p>

<p>Learn how to do it. Visit @elucian's links, and subscribe or donate. Then you know how to do it for yourselve and understand how sponsoring works in real life. I had hard time understanding this. Why whould someone donate or sponsor somebody else? Because it gives you "sponsor" reputation. This is hugely important in freelancing.</p>
