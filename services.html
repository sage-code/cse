<h2>Service Details</h2>

<h3><a id="git">Git Repository</a></h3>
<p>We offer private Git repository for version control. This service has a cap limit of 2Gb/project and is available 24/7. This repository will be hosted on our domain server in Los Angeles.</p>

<h3><a id="ftp">FTP Storage</a></h3>
<p>We offer FTP file transfer storage to upload test data and download project released files or computation results. This service has a cap limit of 10GB and is available 24/7. This service is hosted on our Linux router. </p>

<h3><a id="database">Database</a></h3>

<p>We user account and schema, that you can use to create back-end API and services for your app. We can assist you with creation of custom structure and required data pipeline. At this time, we support PostgreSQL and MariaDB. In the future we will offer other databases.</p>

<h3><a id="build">Build</a></h3>

<p>Your build will be scheduled to run every day. We interlace projects so the build jobs are using full Linux server capacity for each project. After build we run a unit test, and then we archive the results and prepare the release artifacts for download.</p>

<h3><a id="testing">Testing</a></h3>

<p>We enable creation of functional end2end test. This is done using Jenkins test automation platform. We set-up several testing jobs customized for the specifics of your project: dry-run, smoke-test, nightly-test and weekly-test can be scheduled. We publish test logs for you to download and investigate. Not all projects require test automation.</p>

<h3><a id="robot">Robot</a></h3>

<p>We enable creation of fast computation agents that can run on schedule. A robot is a script that can be executed on 6 core CPU and 6xGPU rigs. We own 2 AMD mining rigs. We schedule the robots to run for 8h every day. We can serve 2 users concurrently on different rigs. When the time is up, the job is interrupted and will run again next day.</p>

<div class="alert alert-danger"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>We reserve service time exclusive for 1 job at a time so it will not run in parallel with any other jobs. This way you can verify the time spent for your job to find performance bottlenecks and improve your algorithm.</div>

<h3><a id="backup">Backup</a></h3>

<p>We perform a periodic backup on internal HDD automatically every day. We backup test data and source code. This is a convenient way to protect your projects or data from hacker attacks. Our backup can be used to download data from the cloud.</p>

<p>We use a dedicated backup machine. This is a workstation with blue-ray, DVD writer, USB3 and SD memory card slots. It has large capacity internal RAID, WD Raptor OS disk (no SSD), redundant high capacity storage and external HDD slots. We backup your data on external HDD once/week.</p>

<h3><a id="archive">Archive</a></h3>

<p>We offer a long term archive for your project on DVD/R or BD/R (blue-ray). We create this archive on demand one single time. We store the archives safely in a vault, protected against sun-light, dust, heat and humidity. If you have an archive we can restore from it and provide a link for download.</p>

<h3><a id="subdomain">Subdomain</a></h3>

<p>We offer a subdomain for your hosted app. This can be a dynamic website or back-end app. We will help you to setup a pipeline to maintain and publish your project. We setup the environment manually, so it may take some time. We offer SSH connection to our bare-bone machine.</p>
