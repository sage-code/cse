        <strong>The Sage-Code Methodology:</strong> We believe a strong community is essential for mastery, which is why we integrate Discord and Substack for real-time interaction. Through live conferences and instant voice rooms, we bridge the gap between theory and practice with face-to-face mentorship and collaborative sessions. This ensures you have the necessary features to learn, contribute, and work effectively in a global, remote-first landscape.
