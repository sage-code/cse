<h2>Service Details</h2>

<h3><a id="git">Git Repository</a></h3>
<p>We use GitHub for version control. We have migrated all our projects to GitHub in private and public repositories. Most of our projects are under <a href="https://github.com/sage-code">SageCode organization</a>. Every developer & mentor can have it's own projects hosted under his own account. We manage only common projects under Sage-Code and not individual projects.

<h3><a id="host">Hosting</a></h3>  

<p><a href="https://vercel.com">Vercel</a> is a strong option for project hosting if you prioritize speed, security, and ease of use.  Their "Frontend Cloud" platform streamlines deployment and integrates with popular Git providers.  This allows you to focus on development while Vercel handles infrastructure and global content delivery for a fast user experience.  Plus, their automatic scaling and built-in security features ensure your project stays up and running smoothly.

<p>We use internet services to create and manage PostgreSQL databases. One of our favorite provider: <a href="https://neon.tech/">Neon</a> provide free and payed subscription for hosting your database. We will use this service to create and manage our own serverless databases</p>

<p>We preffer to use PostgreSQL over other databases for it's reach features and low price. As you know PostgreSQL is open source and is a hybrid database. We know how to laverage stored procedures using pgSQL and how to optimize structure of these databases for highest performance.</p>
